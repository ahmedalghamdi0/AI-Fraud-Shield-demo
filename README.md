![photo_2025-12-10_18-55-11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc5bd1df-0b91-48c9-967c-6c1b516f1c7d)

 This repository is a public demo version created for presentation and portfolio purposes only. The full implementation, core logic, and detection algorithms are maintained in a private repository.
Project Overview

AI Fraud Shield is an AI-powered security system designed to protect user accounts from modern cyber threats by moving beyond traditional authentication methods.

Instead of relying only on static credentials such as passwords and OTPs, the system continuously analyzes user behavior in real time to detect suspicious activity and respond automatically.

Security is behavior-based, not just credential-based.

## The Problem with Traditional Login Systems

Most current authentication systems rely on:

Passwords

One-Time Passwords (OTP)

This makes accounts vulnerable to:

Unauthorized login attempts

Access from unfamiliar devices or locations

Identity theft without the user noticing

## !!!  Core issue:
Authentication methods are static, while attacks are intelligent and constantly evolving.

 The Solution: AI Fraud Shield (AI-Powered)

AI Fraud Shield adds an advanced security layer that operates silently in the background by:

Analyzing user behavior in real time

Continuously learning normal usage patterns

Detecting anomalies within seconds

Automatically responding based on calculated risk

## How the Intelligent System Works (Conceptual)
1️- Real-Time Behavioral Analysis

The system evaluates behavioral signals such as:

Trusted devices

Geographic location

Typing speed and interaction patterns

2️- Instant Anomaly Detection

Anomalies may include:

Unusual login attempts

Sensitive account changes

Multiple attempts in a short time frame

3️- Automated Security Response

Based on an AI-calculated Risk Score, the system may:

Request additional verification

Automatically terminate sessions

Block suspicious attempts

-----
** Example Risk Decision Logic (Illustrative)

Shown for explanation only — actual logic is private.

If risk_score > 5 → High Risk

If 2 < risk_score ≤ 5 → Verification Required

If risk_score ≤ 1 → No Risk Detected

This logic aligns with global cybersecurity best practices such as:

NIST

ISO 27005

UEBA Frameworks

## Security Operations Dashboard (SOC)

The system provides a Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard that displays:

Login attempts with risk assessment

Device and geographic analysis

Typing behavior insights

Security alerts and automated decisions

 Screenshots, diagrams, and UI previews are included in this demo repository.

 Testing Results (From Internal Evaluation)

Anomaly detection accuracy: 92%

Average response time: < 200ms

Undetected breaches: 0

False positives: Minimal and continuously reduced through baseline updates
